# Changelog

All notable changes to ACP Kit packages are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

While ACP Kit is in `0.x`, **minor versions may include breaking changes** (per the SemVer 0.x convention). Patch versions remain backward compatible.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.6] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` now gives explicit renderer flags predictable precedence: `--cli` selects the plain renderer even when the legacy `ACP_REVIEW_TUI=1` compatibility flag is present, while `--tui` can still override `ACP_REVIEW_CLI=1`.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` CLI configuration errors, such as unsupported `AUTHOR_AGENT` / `REVIEWER_AGENT` values, are now reported through the normal startup formatter instead of leaking an uncaught stack trace before the CLI error handler is installed.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` reviewer prompts now include the current round and previous reviewer feedback passed by the engine, so later review rounds have explicit context about what was already requested.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` turn collection failures that happen before an ACP `turn.failed` / `turn.cancelled` event now emit a renderer `turnFailed` event before the error propagates.

### Changed

- Rebuilt the recent changelog history so the `0.6.1` through `0.6.5` entries reflect the actual package, runtime, renderer, documentation, and test changes shipped in those releases.
- Added a package-local `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` changelog and included it in the package's published files.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` task input can now be inline text or a relative/absolute UTF-8 task file; file input is read once at startup and the resolved source is shown in run summaries.
- The Ink TUI is now the default renderer. `--cli` / `ACP_REVIEW_CLI=1` select the plain renderer, while `--tui` / `ACP_REVIEW_TUI=1` remain accepted for compatibility.
- TUI users can edit the task in an external editor before launch or after reviewer approval, then continue the same AUTHOR/REVIEWER sessions with the updated task.
- TUI users can force another AUTHOR/REVIEWER round after reviewer approval without editing the task.
- TUI panes now show cumulative input/output token usage when agents report ACP usage data.
- TUI tool-call navigation now supports selecting concrete tool calls with `[` / `]` and opening a full input/output detail view with `Enter` / `d`.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` now has focused Vitest coverage for CLI config parsing, engine approval continuation, runtime role cleanup, turn failure cleanup, and state reduction.

### Fixed

- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` bounds retained raw ACP trace entries by both entry count and serialized byte size so trace-heavy runs do not grow UI state without limit.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` state reduction now tolerates partial turn snapshots and missing tool character counts without throwing or producing `NaN`.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` cleans up created sessions, spawned terminals, and runtimes when model setup fails during role startup.
- `@acp-kit/core` command detection now handles Windows path extensions and command lookup edge cases more reliably.
- `@acp-kit/core` normalized events and turn-result collection cover additional edge cases for missing text, usage updates, and terminal tool metadata.

### Changed

- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` moved pane, trace, usage, and result bookkeeping into a dedicated reducer module shared by renderers.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` README and site docs now describe the default TUI, plain renderer opt-in, task-file input, task editing, tool detail view, token usage display, and editor timeout environment variable.
- `@acp-kit/core` docs and runtime examples were refreshed for the renamed AcpKit organization and the current agent matrix.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- `detectInstalledAgents(...)` and `isCommandOnPath(...)` in `@acp-kit/core` for fast, side-effect-free agent availability checks.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` now checks configured AUTHOR and REVIEWER agents before prompting or launching the loop, while preserving runtime fallback command behavior.

### Fixed

- `@acp-kit/core` Node transport now reuses the shared command detection helper instead of duplicating lookup logic.

### Changed

- Author/reviewer loop success output is more visually distinct in both plain and TUI renderers.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Built-in agent profiles now launch local agent binaries first and fall back to their `npx ...@latest` commands when the binary is not on `PATH`.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` now gives hosted demo agents local file-system and terminal capabilities rooted at the selected workspace, with trace capture available in both plain and TUI renderers.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` renderers now show compact command/input and output previews for tool calls, collapse large continuous tool-call bursts, and expose a raw ACP trace view in the TUI.
- `@acp-kit/core` added broad edge-case test coverage for agent profile fallback, startup diagnostics, runtime inspection, recordings, normalization, sessions, transcripts, and turn-result collection.

### Fixed

- Node child-process transport now handles spawn errors such as `ENOENT` without crashing the host process and records the failure in startup diagnostics.
- Runtime inspector and diagnostic capture now handle large or unusual wire frames more robustly.

### Changed

- Agent docs and compatibility issue templates now document the fast local command names while noting the automatic `npx` fallback behavior.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` now captures trace data for TUI runs even when `ACP_REVIEW_TRACE` is not printing JSONL to stderr, enabling the in-app trace view.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- `collectTurnResult(session, prompt, options)` in `@acp-kit/core`, a turn-level helper that collects streaming session events into one result object while still exposing live `onEvent` and `onUpdate` callbacks for UIs.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` now has a renderer-agnostic loop engine plus plain and Ink TUI renderers.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop --tui` for a fullscreen split-pane AUTHOR/REVIEWER view with round navigation, pane scrolling, and soft wrapping.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` now includes modular CLI helpers for argument/env parsing, confirmation prompts, run summaries, startup error formatting, shell-specific environment examples, runtime role startup, and per-turn event normalization.
- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` keeps the legacy `runAuthorReviewerLoop({ config, renderer })` adapter for callers that used the earlier single-file demo shape.
- Core and package documentation now include `collectTurnResult(...)` and the author/reviewer loop architecture.

### Changed

- `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` now uses `commander` for CLI parsing and keeps CLI, config, runtime, engine, and renderer code in separate modules.
- The author/reviewer loop validates configured models during startup. If an agent reports available models and the configured model is invalid, the CLI fails before the first turn and prints the available model ids plus shell-appropriate environment variable examples.
- The TUI header now combines author/reviewer agent, model, and status into one status row; long task text and pane output are wrapped for readability.
- The author/reviewer package now declares optional `ink` and `react` dependencies for TUI mode while keeping the plain renderer lazy-loaded and lightweight.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- New `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` package, a runnable split-context `npx` demo where an AUTHOR agent modifies files and a REVIEWER agent inspects them in a separate context until `APPROVED`.
- The package ships `acp-author-reviewer-loop` and `author-reviewer-loop` bin aliases, default Copilot AUTHOR / Codex REVIEWER profiles, model and round configuration through environment variables, confirmation prompts, and README usage docs.

### Changed

- Replaced the old `examples/pair-programming/` folder with the publishable `packages/author-reviewer-loop/` CLI package.
- Repository release automation and package metadata were updated so `@acp-kit/author-reviewer-loop` can be published alongside `@acp-kit/core`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- `createAcpRuntime({ agent })` now works without a `host`. The runtime defaults to approving tool permissions once and selecting the first offered auth method; pass an explicit host for production policy, UI prompts, file system/terminal capabilities, logging, or wire middleware.
- `PermissionDecision` constants (`AllowOnce`, `AllowAlways`, `Deny`) for host permission decisions, while keeping the existing string literals backward compatible.
- Enterprise runtime hooks: `observability.sink`, durable `eventStore.append/load`, external `approvals`, runtime correlation `context`, and replay helpers (`createRuntimeReplay`, `loadRuntimeReplay`, `replayRuntimeEvents`, `buildTranscriptFromRuntimeEvents`).
- Startup diagnostics via `AcpStartupError`, `isAcpStartupError(...)`, and `formatStartupDiagnostics(...)`.
- Runtime inspection via `createRuntimeInspector(...)` with optional redacted wire-frame capture.
- Session recording via `createMemorySessionRecorder(...)`, `loadSessionRecording(...)`, and Node JSONL helpers (`createFileSessionRecorder(...)`, `loadFileSessionRecording(...)`).

### Fixed

- Corrected permission-decision docs to use the actual supported deny value (`'deny'`) instead of non-existent `deny_once` / `deny_always` variants.
- Improved npm package metadata and README wording so searches for Agent Client Protocol framework/runtime terms can discover the package more reliably.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-22

Minor release with **breaking API changes** (allowed by 0.x SemVer). Renames the agent-selection surface so that what you pass to the runtime reads as "which agent", not "which configuration preset". Also expands the set of agents that ship as built-in named constants from 3 to 6.

### Breaking

- `RuntimeOptions.profile` is now `RuntimeOptions.agent`. Same for `RunOneShotPromptOptions.profile` (`runOneShotPrompt`), `AcpTransport.connect({ profile })`, and `AcpConnectionFactory.create({ profile })`. The field type is now strictly `AgentProfile` &mdash; **string ids are no longer accepted**; import the named constant instead.
- `RuntimeSession.profile` is now `RuntimeSession.agent` (read-only).
- Removed: `BuiltInProfileId`, `builtInProfiles`, `resolveAgentProfile`. Code that did `profile: 'claude'` should switch to `agent: ClaudeCode` (`import { ClaudeCode } from '@acp-kit/core'`).
- The startup-error message format changed from `... failed for profile "X".` to `... failed for agent "X".`.

### Added

- Six built-in agent constants exported from `@acp-kit/core`, all typed as `AgentProfile`:
  - `GitHubCopilot` &mdash; `npx @github/copilot-language-server@latest --acp`
  - `ClaudeCode` &mdash; `npx @zed-industries/claude-code-acp@latest`
  - `CodexCli` &mdash; `npx @zed-industries/codex-acp@latest`
  - `GeminiCli` &mdash; `npx @google/gemini-cli@latest --experimental-acp`
  - `QwenCode` &mdash; `npx @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest --acp --experimental-skills`
  - `OpenCode` &mdash; `npx opencode-ai@latest acp`

  Override individual fields with a spread: `{ ...ClaudeCode, env: { ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: '...' } }`.

### Why

The word "profile" suggested a configuration preset, but the value really answered "which agent". Accepting bare strings (`profile: 'claude'`) made typos a runtime failure and made it awkward to override a single field. Named constants give IDE autocompletion, compile-time safety, and a one-line spread for partial overrides &mdash; while still letting custom agents drop in via a plain `AgentProfile` literal.

### Migration

```ts
// Before (0.4.x):
import { createAcpRuntime } from '@acp-kit/core';
await using acp = createAcpRuntime({ profile: 'claude', host });

// After (0.5.0):
import { createAcpRuntime, ClaudeCode } from '@acp-kit/core';
await using acp = createAcpRuntime({ agent: ClaudeCode, host });

// Custom agent (was already supported, now passed under `agent`):
await using acp = createAcpRuntime({
  agent: { id: 'my-agent', displayName: 'My Agent', command: 'my-cli', args: ['--acp'] },
  host,
});
```

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-22

Minor release. Aligns the runtime more closely with the upstream `agent-client-protocol` spec (currently v0.12.0, SDK ^0.18.0). No breaking changes for existing callers; only additive surface and one cosmetic correction.

### Added

- `RuntimeHost.promptCapabilities?: { image?, audio?, embeddedContext? }` &mdash; declared at construction; forwarded verbatim to the agent in `initialize.clientCapabilities.promptCapabilities`. Hosts that can render images, audio, or embedded resource references should opt in here so the agent is allowed to send those `ContentBlock` variants in `session/prompt` updates. Defaults to omitted (agent assumes text-only).
- `AcpRuntime.listSessions(params?)` &mdash; thin wrapper over ACP `session/list`. Throws if the agent does not advertise `agentCapabilities.sessionCapabilities.list`. Cursor-based pagination via the request's `cursor` and the response's `nextCursor`.
- `RuntimeSession.close()` &mdash; thin wrapper over ACP `session/close` (currently exposed by the SDK as `unstable_closeSession`). After the agent acknowledges, the session is also disposed locally. Falls back to `dispose()` when the agent does not advertise the capability, so it is safe to call unconditionally.
- `AcpTransportConnection` and `AcpConnectionLike` gain optional `listSessions?` and `unstable_closeSession?` slots for custom transports.

### Changed

- `initialize.clientInfo` now reports the actual installed package name and version (read from this package's own `package.json` at runtime) instead of the previously hardcoded `'@acp-kit/core' / '0.1.4'` placeholder. Bundlers that strip `node:fs` will fall back to `'@acp-kit/core' / '0.0.0'`.

### Removed

- Dropped three `sessionUpdate` cases from the notification normalizer that were never produced by the spec: `config_options_update` (plural duplicate of `config_option_update`), `modes_update`, and `models_update`. Mode state changes still flow through `current_mode_update` (unchanged), and the initial mode/model state advertised by `newSession` / `loadSession` continues to be replayed via `session.modes.updated` / `session.models.updated` events. No caller in the example apps was subscribed to the dropped variants; if a custom agent really did emit them, they were already being silently dropped at one layer and re-emitted as `session.unknown` &mdash; this just removes the dead branches.

### Why

A pass over the upstream spec (schema v0.12.0, CHANGELOG through v0.11.7) flagged: stale `clientInfo`, no opt-in for prompt content beyond text, and no surface for the now-stable `session/list` and the preview-stage `session/close`. This release closes those gaps without introducing any of the still-experimental surfaces (`elicitation/*`, `providers/*`, `session/fork`, `session/resume`); those will get evaluated once they stabilize.

### Migration

No changes required. Hosts that want to advertise richer prompt content should set `promptCapabilities` on the host object passed to `createAcpRuntime`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-22

Patch release. Backwards compatible additions extracted from real daemon usage.

### Added

- `isAcpCancelled(error)` &mdash; returns `true` for JSON-RPC code `-32800` or messages matching `cancelled` / `canceled` / `aborted`. Use to distinguish "the agent cancelled this turn" from "the agent failed".
- `isAcpAuthRequired(error)` &mdash; returns `true` for JSON-RPC code `-32000` or messages requiring authentication. Same logic the runtime already uses internally for `withAuthRetry`, now exposed so callers can react identically (e.g. surface a "sign in" UI).
- `RuntimePermissionRequest.title: string` &mdash; the human-readable title surfaced by the agent for the operation needing approval (extracted from `toolCall.title` on the raw payload). Hosts no longer need to dig through `request.raw?.toolCall?.title` to render a prompt.

Both helpers re-exported from the main entry (`@acp-kit/core`); `RuntimePermissionRequest` is unchanged in shape, only adds an extra field.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-22

Minor release. No breaking changes &mdash; only new opt-in exports under `@acp-kit/core/node`.

### Added

- `createLocalFileSystemHost({ root, onAccess?, followSymlinksOutsideRoot? })` &mdash; reference implementation of ACP's `fs/read_text_file` and `fs/write_text_file` for hosts that serve a single local workspace root. Sandboxed by lexical resolution + `realpath` check; rejects `..` traversal and (by default) symlinks pointing outside `root`. Supports the `line` / `limit` slicing parameters and auto-creates parent directories on write.
- `createLocalTerminalHost({ resolveCwd?, env?, defaultOutputByteLimit? })` &mdash; reference implementation of ACP's terminal capability via `node:child_process.spawn`. Bounded ring buffer for output, exit code + signal capture, optional `waitForTerminalExit` timeout. `releaseTerminal` releases host bookkeeping but does **not** kill the underlying process (matches ACP spec semantics; previous in-house copies in user codebases often killed on release &mdash; review your call sites if you migrate).
- Both helpers exported from `@acp-kit/core/node` (they pull in `node:fs` / `node:child_process`, so they stay off the main entry).

### Why

The `RuntimeHost` interface is intentionally minimal &mdash; permission policy, UI bridging, and audit logging belong in the host. But the local-disk implementation of fs and terminal capabilities is roughly the same in every daemon-shaped host, and writing it from scratch per project (with subtle path-escape and output-bounding bugs) is exactly the boilerplate ACP Kit exists to delete. These are explicit `import`s, not defaults &mdash; hosts that need their own implementation (VS Code's terminal API, remote agents, container sandboxes) ignore them.

### Migration

Existing hosts continue to work unchanged. To opt in:

```ts
import { createAcpRuntime } from '@acp-kit/core';
import { createLocalFileSystemHost, createLocalTerminalHost } from '@acp-kit/core/node';

const fsHost = createLocalFileSystemHost({ root: workingDirectory });
const termHost = createLocalTerminalHost({ resolveCwd: (cwd) => resolveSessionPath(workingDirectory, cwd) });

const runtime = createAcpRuntime({
  profile,
  host: { ...fsHost, ...termHost, requestPermission, onAgentExit },
});
```

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-22

Patch release. Non-breaking.

### Added

- `RuntimeSession.transcript` &mdash; read-only public getter returning the session's reducer state (messages, reasoning, tool calls, mode / model state, open stream ids, usage). Useful for reading the initial mode / model state populated by `newSession` / `loadSession` before the first handler has a chance to attach, and for rendering UI snapshots mid-stream without resubscribing. Previously only accessible via `getSnapshot()`, which returned a deep clone on each call.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-22

Patch release. Non-breaking additions to the normalized event surface so every ACP session update has a typed runtime event and vendor extensions survive the normalization layer.

### Added

- `ToolStartEvent` / `ToolUpdateEvent` / `ToolEndEvent` now carry an optional `meta?: Record<string, unknown>` field, forwarding the raw `_meta` object from the underlying ACP update verbatim. ACP's `_meta` is the spec-defined vendor-extension slot &mdash; consumers that want vendor-specific tool names, arguments, or responses (e.g. `_meta.claudeCode.toolName`) no longer have to attach a wire middleware to reach them.
- New `SessionErrorEvent` (`type: 'session.error'`) mapping ACP's `session_error` session-update variant. `RuntimeEventHandlers.sessionError?: (e) => void` is now part of the handler-map dispatch (`session.on({ sessionError: ... })`), and `RuntimeEventKind.SessionError` is exported.

### Compatibility

Both additions are non-breaking: existing code that did not read `meta` or handle `session.error` continues to work unchanged.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-21

Minor release with **breaking changes** (allowed in 0.x). The dual normalized / raw event surface is collapsed into a single normalized track, and the helper is reshaped into an idiomatic handler-map dispatch.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Removed the raw session-update track.** `session.onRawNotification`, `session.events()`, `onRawSessionUpdate`, `SessionUpdateKind`, and `packages/core/src/session-update.ts` are gone. All consumers now go through the normalized `RuntimeSessionEvent` stream (`message.delta`, `tool.start` / `tool.update` / `tool.end`, `turn.completed`, ...). For unfiltered raw access, attach a wire middleware via `createAcpRuntime({ wireMiddleware })`.
- **`session.prompt(text)` returns `Promise<PromptResult>` only.** It no longer doubles as an `AsyncIterable` of `PromptHandle` notifications. Subscribe to events via `session.on(...)` *before* calling `prompt(...)`.
- **Added `session.on(handlers)` overload** that takes a camelCase handler map (`{ messageDelta, toolStart, toolEnd, turnCompleted, ... }`) covering every `RuntimeSessionEvent`. The single-event-type and `'event'` overloads remain.
- **`runOneShotPrompt(...)` now yields normalized `RuntimeSessionEvent`s** instead of raw `PromptHandle` notifications. Same name, same one-shot lifecycle, new payload type.
- **Fixed prototype-strip bug in `transports/node.ts`.** The default node transport was spreading the underlying `ClientSideConnection` into a new object, which silently dropped class-prototype methods like `initialize` and `prompt`. The transport now mutates `dispose` in place to keep the original instance intact.

### Examples

- New **`examples/pair-programming/`** &mdash; two ACP agents (AUTHOR + REVIEWER) collaborating on the same `cwd` until the reviewer says `APPROVED`. Demonstrates per-role profile + model + prompt settings, parallel agent launch, and handler-map event dispatch.
- Removed `examples/advanced-multi-session/` (superseded by `pair-programming/`, which is a stronger multi-session demo).
- `examples/quick-start/` and all docs migrated to `runOneShotPrompt` + `session.on({ ... })` handler-map style.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-23

Patch release. Naming-only change: the one-shot helper is renamed to better describe what it does.

### Changed (breaking)

- `runAcpAgent(...)` and the `RunAcpAgentOptions` interface are renamed to **`runOneShotPrompt(...)`** / **`RunOneShotPromptOptions`**. The shape, behavior, and return type are unchanged. The old name returned an async iterable that spawned an agent, ran a single prompt, and disposed everything on completion — but "agent" referred to the *remote* process, not the helper itself, and "run" suggested a long-lived thing. The new name describes the actual lifecycle: **one prompt, then teardown**. Migration is a single find-and-replace.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-23

Patch release. No breaking changes — existing `createAcpRuntime` / `runAcpAgent` / `session.prompt(...)` code keeps working unchanged.

This release makes `AcpRuntime` actually behave the way the README promised: **one runtime owns one agent subprocess, and that subprocess hosts as many ACP sessions as you create**. Previously, every call to `acp.newSession(...)` spawned a fresh process and ran a full `initialize` handshake. Now `initialize` happens once on the first `newSession` / `loadSession` / `ready()` call, and every subsequent session reuses the same connection.

### Added

- `acp.loadSession({ sessionId, cwd?, mcpServers? })` — resume a previously created ACP session by id. Throws if the agent does not advertise the `loadSession` capability.
- `acp.ready()` — explicitly spawn the agent process and complete `initialize` without creating a session yet. Useful for warming up or for inspecting `agentInfo` / `authMethods` before deciding what to do.
- `acp.isReady` — boolean getter, `true` once the agent has been initialized.
- `acp.agentInfo`, `acp.authMethods`, `acp.agentCapabilities`, `acp.protocolVersion` — agent metadata returned by `initialize`. `null` / empty until the runtime has connected.
- `NewSessionOptions.mcpServers?: McpServer[]` and `LoadSessionOptions.mcpServers?: McpServer[]` — properly typed (was `unknown[]`). Forwarded to ACP `session/new` and `session/load` respectively.
- `AcpConnectionFactory.create(...).loadSession?(...)` — optional capability used by `acp.loadSession`.

### Changed (non-breaking)

- One agent subprocess per `AcpRuntime` (was: one per session). `acp.shutdown()` still tears everything down the same way; `session.dispose()` no longer closes the underlying process — the runtime owns its lifecycle.
- The `auth_required` retry path is now a shared internal helper used by both `newSession` and `loadSession`.
- ACP `session/update` notifications are now routed to the matching session via the notification's own `sessionId`, instead of being assumed to belong to a single session.

### Tests

- Added coverage for: shared-process behavior across multiple sessions, `agentInfo` / `authMethods` / `agentCapabilities` exposure, `session/update` routing across two concurrent sessions, `loadSession` happy path, and the `loadSession` capability check.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-22

This release reshapes the public API around two ergonomic entry points and aligns the streaming surface with raw ACP. `createRuntime` from 0.1.x stays exported as an alias for `createAcpRuntime`; everything else listed under "breaking" below is a hard change.

### Added

- `createAcpRuntime(options)` — primary entry point. Returns an `AcpRuntime` that owns one agent subprocess and can host multiple sessions.
- `runAcpAgent({ profile, cwd, prompt, host?, ... })` — one-shot helper that returns `AsyncIterable<SessionNotification>` and tears down the runtime when iteration ends. *(Renamed to `runOneShotPrompt` in 0.1.4.)*
- `Symbol.asyncDispose` on both `AcpRuntime` and `RuntimeSession`. Use `await using acp = createAcpRuntime(...)` and `await using session = await acp.newSession({ cwd })` to get automatic cleanup. Requires Node ≥ 20.11 (or TypeScript 5.2+ down-leveling).
- `acp.shutdown()` — explicit, idempotent runtime teardown when `await using` is not available.
- `session.prompt(text)` now returns a `PromptHandle` that is **both** a `Promise<PromptResult>` **and** an `AsyncIterable<SessionNotification>` for the turn. Iterate it to consume raw ACP notifications, or `await` it for the final result.
- `session.events()` — `AsyncIterable<SessionNotification>` for the lifetime of the session.
- `session.onRawNotification(fn)` — listener form of the raw stream.
- `examples/advanced-multi-session/` — demonstrates one runtime hosting two `await using` sessions over different `cwd`s.

### Changed (breaking)

- `RuntimeOptions.cwd` removed. Pass `cwd` per session via `acp.newSession({ cwd })`.
- `createRuntime` is now a thin alias for `createAcpRuntime`. New code should prefer `createAcpRuntime`.
- `session.prompt(text)` previously returned `Promise<PromptResult>`. It now returns a `PromptHandle`. Existing `await session.prompt(...)` code keeps working unchanged.
- `examples/quick-start/` rewritten around `runAcpAgent`. `examples/real-agent-cli/` and `examples/mock-runtime/` migrated to `createAcpRuntime` + per-session `cwd`.

### Docs

- README, package README, and the doc site (`docs/`) rewritten around the dual-track API and the real ACP `session/update` discriminators (`agent_message_chunk`, `tool_call`, `tool_call_update`, `plan`, `agent_thought_chunk`, ...).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- `author: "ACP Kit contributors"` in `packages/core/package.json` so the npm page no longer shows a personal username as the package author.
- Restructured `examples/` into three focused, self-contained scenarios:
  - [`examples/quick-start/`](examples/quick-start/) — minimal runnable mirror of the README Quick Start.
  - [`examples/mock-runtime/`](examples/mock-runtime/) — fully self-contained mock ACP server, runs without any agent installed (`npm run demo`).
  - [`examples/real-agent-cli/`](examples/real-agent-cli/) — interactive CLI driver against real ACP agents (`npm run demo:real`).
- New root scripts: `demo:quick-start`, `demo:real`.
- `examples/README.md` index.

### Removed

- `examples/runtime-demo.mjs` (replaced by the three focused examples above).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-21

Initial public release.

### Added

- `@acp-kit/core` package: a single-package runtime built on `@agentclientprotocol/sdk`.
- `createRuntime({ profile, cwd, host })` entry point.
- Built-in agent profiles for Copilot CLI, Claude ACP, and Codex ACP.
- Cross-platform process spawn with startup timeout, stderr capture, and exit diagnostics.
- ACP connection bootstrap: `initialize`, `session/new`, `session/prompt`, `session/cancel`.
- Auth retry when `session/new` returns `auth_required`, via host `chooseAuthMethod` callback.
- Host adapters: `requestPermission`, `chooseAuthMethod`, `readTextFile`, `writeTextFile`, `createTerminal`, `log`.
- Normalized runtime events for messages, reasoning, tools, usage, mode/model updates.
- Transcript reducer with pending stream completion flushing for clean turn finalization.
- Mock + real-agent runnable demo at `examples/runtime-demo.mjs`.
